Revision history for Perl extension Parse::CPinfo.

0.88    Sun Apr  8 19:00:00 2007
	- Initial public release.

0.881  Mon Apr  9 20:29:35 2007
	- Updated POD to include correct example using method and not
	  directly reading variables.
	- Folded private _parse method into the read function.  Previously,
	  all data was read into a private _cpinfo_data variable and then
	  parsed.  Now, data is parsed as it is read, improving speed by a
	  factor of 3.
	- Renamed the read function to readfile at the recommendation of 
	  perlcritic.
	- Updated README to better show testing coverage.
	- Accepted some recommendations from perlcritic.
	- Told Perl that the regular expressions will not be changing via
	  the /o option.

0.882  Wed Apr 11 17:17:17 2007
	- Added option to parse hostname
	- Removed external module dependencies.
